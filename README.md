# GoChatBot

GoChatBot is a Golang-based chatbot using [goWebgui](https://github.com/Schmiddiii/goWebGui) to display the messages in your browser.

## Usage

To install this project use `go get github.com/Schmiddiii/goChatBot` and run main.go using `go run main.go`. This will create the backend of the bot. To show the bot type `localhost:3030` into your brower and chat with the bot. It knows almost no information and will mainly respond that he doesnÂ´t know what to say. This is normal as you can teach the bot how to behave. To teach a bot answers type in `!a activation -> response1; response 2`, where activation is the sentence to reply to and the responses are the sentences he may answer. This is of course not much information but this project is mainly an example of how to use [goWebgui](https://github.com/Schmiddiii/goWebGui).
